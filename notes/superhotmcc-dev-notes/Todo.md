- Disable fall death timer when Mario is in control.

- Fix spurious collisions with large distant triangles.

    - Experiment with dynamic collision mesh gen for static level geometry.

- Fix Mario's shadow clipping.
    -Try updating his tag's bounds.

- Render a false projectile exiting the player's barel.
    - False projectile should converge with the actual projectile over distance.
